            <p>The fully integrated Garmin G1000NXi flight deck with standard 3-axis GFC700 Automated Flight Control System and yaw damper
                and Electronic Stability and Protection, is complemented by a long list of avionics options to perfectly suit your mission.
                Integrated weather radar, normally available only on much more expensive aircraft, is available as are Traffic Alerting,
                Synthetic Vision, and much more. The Line Replaceable Units (LRU’s) are located in a dedicated and externally accessible
                forward avionics bay, for ease of maintenance and trouble shooting.</p>

            <p>The turbocharged Austro AE330 jet fuel piston engines perfectly match the DA62’s aerodynamically efficient airframe, burning
            only 17.1 gph, combined, at a high speed cruise of 192 ktas, and little as 9 gph at max endurance speed.</p>
            <p>The 3 blade MT hydraulic constant speed propellers feature advanced blade geometry for efficient performance, smoothness
            and low noise. They are automatically controlled by each engine’s digital engine control through conventional hydraulic governors.
            Feathering is as simple as flipping a single switch.</p>
